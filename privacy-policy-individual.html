              private and secure. It continues to apply even if your
              contractual relationship with Alunafi ends. It should also be

              face-to-face meetings, letters, emails, live chats, video chats
              and any other kinds of communication. We may use these
              recordings to check your instructions to us, assess, analyse and
              improve our service, train our people, manage risk or to prevent
              and detect fraud and other crimes. We may also capture
              additional information about these interactions, e.g. telephone
              numbers that you call us from and information about the devices
              or software that you use. We use closed circuit television
              (CCTV) in and around our premises and these may collect photos
              or videos of you or record your voice. <br /><br />

              terrorism financing, money laundering and other financial
              crimes). We’ll only do this on the basis that it’s needed to
              comply with a legal obligation, it’s in our legitimate interests
              and that of others or to prevent or detect unlawful acts.

            <ul>

                perform our contract with you;
              </li>
              <li>
                to provide operational support: to enable the provision and
                function of our services in line with regulation, laws and
                customer rights and interests, e.g. complaints management and
                exit management. The lawful reasons for processing these are
                legitimate interest, legal obligation and in order to perform
                our contract with you;
              </li>
              <li>
                to prevent and detect crime including, e.g. fraud, terrorist
                financing and money laundering: this will include monitoring,
                mitigation and risk management, carrying out customer due
                diligence, name screening, transaction screening and customer
                risk identification. We do this to comply with our legal
                obligations and because it’s in our legitimate interest. We
                may share your information with relevant agencies, law
                enforcement and other third parties where the law allows us to
                for the purpose of preventing or detecting crime.
                Additionally, we and other financial institutions may take
                steps to help prevent financial crime and manage risk. We’ll
                do this because we have a legitimate interest, a legal
                obligation to prevent or detect crime or it’s in the public
                interest. We may be required to use your information to do
                this, even if you’ve asked us to stop <br />
                using your information. That could include (among other
                things):
              </li>

                  instructions or communications you send or receive
                  (including payment instructions and application forms);
                </li>
                <li>
                  investigating who you’re paying or who’s paying you, e.g.
                  checks on payments into and out of your account and other
                  parties related to those payments;
                </li>
