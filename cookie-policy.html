              website, you may consent, or not to the use of

              When you are navigating on our website, cookies
              enable Alunafi Ltd. to collect in various manners
              information related to the use of the website with
              the intent of improving your overall user
              experience. So, cookies are kind of personal data,
              which is information collected from you and other
              third parties that specifically identifies you as an
              individual from the European GDPR regulation
              ("GDPR": General Data Protection Regulation —
              Regulation (EU) 2016/679) point of view. For further
              information, our Privacy Policy can be found on <a href="https://www.alunafi.com">our

            <p>
              Cookies can be classified in two different ways, by "life span" and by '"domain".<br>
              There are two types of cookies categorised by “life span”:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Session cookies: they only last for the duration
                Of a single browsing session, so they don't have
                an expiration time. They are deleted once the
                browser is closed and are therefore not saved
                on user's device.
              </li>
              <li>
                Persistent cookies: they have an expiration date
                that is appropriate for the information being
                stored, so they do remain stored on the user's
                terminal device for a certain duration. They are
                not automatically erased. Your browser sends
                these cookies back b the website every time
                you visit it again, so it can remember your
                preferences and tailor what you see on the
                screen.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>When it comes to the "domain", a distinction is
              made between:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>First-party cookies that are cookies set by the
                website you're visiting. NO Other website can
                read them.</li>
              <li>Third-party cookies that are set by websites
                when they are using external services, which
                drop their own cookies.</li>
            </ul>

              Here are the different cookies we use on our
              website:
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Necessary cookies</b> — help make a website usable
              by enabling basic functions like page navigation
              and access to secure areas of the website. The
              website cannot function properly without these
              cookies so there are automatically allowed.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Marketing cookies</b> — are used to track visitors
              across websites so you can choose to deny or allow
              their use at any time. The intention is to display ads
              that are relevant and engaging for the individual
              user and thereby more valuable for publishers and
              third-party advertisers.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Preference cookies</b> — enable a website to
              remember information that changes the way the
              website behaves or looks, like your preferred
              language or the region that you are in, so you can
              choose to deny or allow their use at any time.
