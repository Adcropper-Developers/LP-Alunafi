              <p>e) the debit value date or the date of receipt of the Payment Order.</p>
            </ul>
            <p>7.1.7. The information in the Payment Notification shall be sent without undue delay via the Alunafi

              will be actioned in accordance with the time periods set out herein and as soon as reasonably possible

            <p>7.2.2. Aluanfi may treat all apparently valid Instructions purporting to be given by, or on behalf of
              You, as Instructions properly authorised by You.</p>

            <p>7.2.4. You and Your Internet Banking Signatories need to follow the instructions provided to You with
              such additional security measures.</p>
            <p>7.2.5. Where We reasonably believe that an Instruction purporting to come from You or any of Your
              Internet Banking Signatories has not been properly authorised by You or the Internet Banking Signatory or
              that any other breach of security has occurred in relation to Your Use of the Services, we reserve the
              right not to act, or to delay acting upon the Instruction and, in that event, We will inform You as soon
              as reasonably practicable. Alunafi will not have any liability to You if You suffer loss as a result of
              Our decision not to act or to delay in acting on an Instruction in these circumstances.</p>
            <p>7.2.6. You shall ensure that all Instructions sent to Us are complete and accurate. Alunafi will not be
              liable for any loss if an Instruction is not actioned or is actioned incorrectly due to inaccurate or
              incomplete Instructions or if an Instruction is not received by Us.</p>
            <p>7.2.7. You may request Us to cancel or modify any Instruction, but We are only required to use reasonable
              efforts to comply with such request. Alunafi will not be liable for any failure to cancel or modify such
              an Instruction. Such request may carry additional fees as disclosed within the Schedule of Fees. </p>
            <p>7.2.8. We may refuse, at Our discretion and without liability, to act or delay acting on Your Instruction
              if it is a request or Instruction, the effect of which would be to exceed a general limit imposed by Us in
              relation to Your Business Account.</p>
            <p>7.2.9. You should ensure that Your Business Account has sufficient funds to cover the payment You intend
              to make, as well as, any applicable fees. Should the Business Account not have enough available funds, the
              Payment Instructions will not be processed. Alunafi shall not be held liable for any losses or damages
              suffered as a result of such non-processing.</p>
            <p>7.2.10. You shall indemnify and keep Us indemnified against all actions, proceedings, costs, loss or
              damage of any kind We and Our associate undertakings may suffer as a result of acting on Your Instructions

              Terms and Conditions.</p>
            <p>7.3 Payments to Your Business Account</p>
            <p>7.3.1. The following items are acceptable for payment to Your Business Account:</p>
            <ul>
              <p>a) Bank transfers from other bank accounts held in Your name with other credit or financial
                institutions, for which You must provide Your credit or financial institution with Alunafi’s BIC & IBAN
                as reference; and</p>
              <p>b) Transfers from other Alunafi accounts.</p>
            </ul>
            <p>7.3.2. Upon receipt of an inward payment, Alunafi will use its best endeavors to credit the relevant
              amount to Your Business Account immediately and as soon as reasonably practicable. Notwithstanding the
              foregoing, You acknowledge that, in exceptional circumstances beyond Alunafi’s control, immediate
              crediting may not be possible. Furthermore, any amounts received after 17:00 local time shall be credited
              to Your account on the following business day.</p>
            <p>7.3.3. Transfers from other Alunafi accounts will be credited to Your Business Account on the same
              Business Day.</p>
            <p>7.3.4. If a payment is (i) fraudulently or mistakenly paid into Your Business Account, or (ii) refused by
              any competent authorities or if We are obliged to return a payment to the payer for any reason after it
              has been credited to Your Business Account, You agree that the amount of the payment may subsequently be
              deducted by Us. This may occur even if (i) the funds are included in Your Business Account balance, (ii)
              You have used the funds to make a payment or (iii) You have transferred or withdrawn all or part of them.
            </p>
            <p>7.3.5. If the deduction of the payment from Your Business Account would make Your Account go overdrawn,
              You acknowledge that the amount by which Your Account is in debit, shall constitute a debt owing by You to
              Us. Following notification by Us to You that You have a debit balance on Your Business Account, You shall
              promptly reimburse such sum to Us and in any event within 2 Working Days of notification by Us. To the
              extent that You do not reimburse Us within 2 Working Days following notification by Us, We reserve the
              right to charge you a Negative Balance fee. We also reserve the right, at any time, to send You reminders
              or to take other debt collection measures including but not limited to mandating a debt collection agency
              or solicitors or to pursue the claim in court. We reserve the right to charge You the expenses Alunafi
              reasonably incurs in connection with any debt collection or enforcement efforts.</p>
            <p>7.3.6. You should be aware that payments paid into Your Business Account can be reversed. We reserve the
              right to reverse a payment in cases where the Payer or the Payer’s bank has charged back or otherwise
              reversed (or is reasonable likely to charge back or otherwise reverse) a loaded or other payment which was
              used to fund the payment to You.</p>
            <p>7.4 Payments from Your Business Account</p>
            <p>7.4.1. Payments from Your Business Account can be made to a third-party recipient through SEPA Credit
              Transfers and Electronic Fund Transfer or other methods notified to You from time to time. We will process
              and be responsible for processing payments from Your Business Account solely on the basis of the BIC, sort
              code or national bank code of the recipient’s bank and the recipient’s bank account number (or IBAN)
              included in the payment Instructions We receive from You, regardless of any additional information
              provided to Us.</p>
            <p>7.4.2. If incorrect payment details have been provided, the payment may be delayed or credited to a wrong
              account, and We will not be liable for any loss incurred by anyone and/or for any delay to the payment
              being made.</p>
            <p>7.4.3. In addition, Alunafi reserves the right to charge You with a Trace/Recall/Investigation fee plus a
              Rejected Payment Administration fee based on the corresponding third-party banks charges.</p>

            <ul>
              <p>a) SEPA Credit Transfers</p>

                  next available Working Day, as long as it is not a currency holiday. </li>
              </ul>
              <p>The execution of the Payment Transaction is also subject to the relevant processing which is done by
                Alunafi’s counterparties.</p>
              <p>b) International Transfers
                The cut-off time of international transfers is always subject to the relevant currency cut-off times as
                well as the cut-off times of Alunafi’s counterparties. Alunafi will always ensure to execute the Payment
                Order in a timely manner. The applicable cut-off times can be found on the Alunafi Website.
              </p>
            </ul>
            <p>7.4.5. Both SEPA credit transfers and International Transfers will be executed as a “Shared” (SHA)
              payment instruction whereby You will bear fees applied by Us and the beneficiary bears fees applied by the
              beneficiary’s payment service provider. For international transfers there is always the possibility of
              fees being charged by correspondent banks. In this case, these respective fees by the other payment
              service provider will be debited to Your Business Account once communicated to Us by the other payment
              service provider.</p>
            <p>7.4.6. We will give You prior notice of any National and/or Public Holidays during a particular calendar
              month via the Alunafi Platform.</p>
            <p>7.4.7. Outward payments will be reflected in Your Business Account upon authorisation by the Internet
              Banking User(s). You will be able to track the status of each Payment Instruction via the Alunafi
              Platform.</p>
            <p>7.4.8. Payments may be subject to payment limits due to security and legal requirements. You should
              ensure that Your limits are sufficient to cover the payment You intend to make as well as any applicable
              fees.</p>
            <p>7.4.9. When executing transfers from Your Business Account to another Business/Personal Account held with
              Us, You should be aware that the recipient of a payment may be subject to loading, spending and withdrawal
              limits and that this may affect the recipient’s access to the funds You intend to send.</p>
            <p>7.4.10. Transfers from Your Business Account to another Business/Personal Account held with Us will be
              processed on the same day.</p>

              steps We’ll take to make sure it stays private and secure. It continues to apply even if Your contractual
              relationship with Alunafi ends. It should also be read alongside the applicable Terms and Conditions of
              your Business Account/s, as these include sections relating to the use and disclosure of information.
